## About Coal
Coal, a kind of energy, is widely used in such fields as electricity, steel, textile, chemistry and metallurgy, etc.. Raw coal has sulfur and traditional coal blocks has low combustion ratio but high pollution. The hot topic of efficient use of coal attracts people's attention on efficient coal powder preparation for it has high combustion ratio and zero pollution.
