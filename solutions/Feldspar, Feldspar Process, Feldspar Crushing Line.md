Feldspar is the most important rock-forming mineral on the surface of Earth's crust. Feldspar is a general name which contains all kinds of minerals in feldspar group like albite, anorthite, celsian, hyalophane, microcline, orthoclase, sanidine, etc. It contains calcium, sodium and potassium and other aluminosilicate components. The feldspar rich in potassium and sodium is mainly used in ceramics, glass and porcelain production. For some feldspar, rubidium and caesium can be extracted. The bright and beautiful feldspar can be used as ornamental stone and semi-precious stone.
## Feldspar Crushing Technology
Generally, the feldspar is milk white. But if there are impurities, it would present yellow, brown, light red and dark gray and even beautiful iridescence. The specific gravity is between 2.56 and 2.76. And the Moh's hardness is around 6- 6.5. So cone crusher is usually applied for the middle and fine crushing of feldspar.
