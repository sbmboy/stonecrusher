## About Gypsum
Gypsum is the aquo-complex whose main component is CaSO4.It is widely used as industrial and construction material. Usually, the gypsum includes plaster stone and anhydrite. Plaster stone is Ca〔SO4〕•2H2O, also known as hydrated gypsum and soft gypsum. Its structure is compact mass and threadiness and the Moh's hardness of colorful plaster stone is 2. Anhydrite is Ca〔SO4〕and its Moh's hardness is 3-3.5. Its density is 2.8-3.0g/cm3. The two kinds of gypsum is companied by each other and transformed under some geologic conditions. They can be used in cement retarder, gypsum building product, model, medical food additive, vitriol production, paper filler and paint filler,etc..
Fineness|Applications|Recommended Equipment
---|---|---
80-120meshes|Used in gypsum line and board. The anhydrite is applied less.|MTM,MTW,LM
180-200meshes|Used to produce gypsum line and board. The applications are relatively fewer.|MTM,MTW,LM
