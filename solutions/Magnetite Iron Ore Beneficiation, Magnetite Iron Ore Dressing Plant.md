# Magnetite Iron Ore Beneficiation, Magnetite Iron Ore Dressing Plant
## About Magnetite
Magnetite always occurs in deposited metamorphic rocks. The main existence form is disseminated grain. Its gangue is mainly composed of silicate minerals like quartz and amphibolites and ferrosilite.
## Magnetite Beneficiation Technology
Because magnetite has strong magnetism, the weak magnetic separation can recycle high-grade and high-recovery iron concentrate. As for most middle-sized and large-scale magnetic separation plants, when the grain size is above 0.2-0.3mm, one-stage magnetic separation is chosen; when the grain size is below 0.2-0.3mm, two-stage magnetic separation is chosen. If coarse grinding is able to separate qualified tailings, the phased magnetic separation method is taken. If there is wall rock or other minerals in the magnetite, dry magnetic separator can be used before grinding.
