## Gulch gold Beneficiation Technology
The gold content in gulch gold is negligible. To get it, we must sort and purify the gulch gold first. After that, further smelting and processing are required. It is well-known that the specific gravity of gold is much bigger than the sand and gold is free in gulch sand, so the simplest and most valid method to get gold is gravity separation.
