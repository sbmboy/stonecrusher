## Rod Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The power needed to operate a rod mill could exceed 30% of the power used in a ball mill. When they are worn, rods must not stretch but break in rather small pieces, so that they can exit the mill. The energy consumed by rod mills could be from 10 to 30% higher than the energy consumed by bar mills and this is for comparable performance.
