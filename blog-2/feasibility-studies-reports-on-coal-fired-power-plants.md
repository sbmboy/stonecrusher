## '70% Of India's Coal Plants May Fail To Control Pollution 
 · Coal based power plants account for over 60% of particulate emissions from industries in India, as well as 45% of SO2, 30% of NOx & over 80% of mercury emissions. Given seven years to 2022 to comply, 70% of the plants are not on track to meet new emission norms, says a new study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi based think tank.
