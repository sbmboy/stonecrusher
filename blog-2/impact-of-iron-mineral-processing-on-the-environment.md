## Mines and environmental impact
It is primarily from waste in the mining of sulphide ores that serious environmental problems can arise due to their content of iron sulphides such as pyrite and pyrrhotite. When mining waste containing iron sulphides is allowed to lie unsheltered and comes under the effects of weather and wind, it will crumble through an oxidation process.

Environment Canada works to address the environmental impacts of metals and mineral processing. The main processing phases are separation of valuable minerals from unwanted minerals, recovery of valuable minerals from the ore, and metals production and refining. Most of the emissions from processing are to air, but some are also to water and land.
