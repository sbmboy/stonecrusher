Anthracite coal is environmentally friendly. All mining is done on previously mined land that is completely reclaimed and restored. We replenish forest land on old mine sites. Mining re establishes erosion and sedimentation controls that allow rain water to flow to streams naturally. Learn more about Blaschak’s support for the environment »

## Anthracitic Coal, Kentucky Geological Survey, University 
Anthracitic rank marks the beginning of distinctive physical and chemical changes to coal termed anthracitization, graphitization, metadiagenesis, and telodiagenesis in different reports (see figure). The most distinctive physical change at anthracite rank, is the development of conchoidal fracture and the loss of cleats in coal.

## Metallurgical Coal Home Ram River Coal Corp.
Metallurgical coal is more scarce and valuable than thermal coal, so in practice metallurgical coal is rarely used to generate electricity. Metallurgical coal is also common ly referred to as coking coal. Coking coal has physical properties that when heated cause it to soften, liquefy and then resolidify into a harder substance known as coke.

## Differentiation of coking & non coking coals
Differentiation of coking & non coking coals: From physical appearance it is very difficult if not impossible to differentiate between non coking & a coking coal. A non caking coal is that coal which when heated in the absence of air for e.g. as in the determination of VM, leaves a powdery residue. A non caking coal is always a non coking coal.

## What Is the Difference Between Coal and Coke? Referencem
What Is the Difference Between Coal and Coke? The basic difference between coal and coke is that coal is the natural source and coke is the derivative product produced by destructive distillation. Both are used as fuel, but coke contains a higher carbon content and few impurities. Coke is also used during iron ore smelting as a reducing agent.

## Classification of Coal Engineering ToolBox
Coal is a readily combustible rock containing more than 50 percent by weight of carbonaceous material formed from compaction and indurations of variously altered plant remains similar to those in peat.. After a considerable amount of time, heat, and burial pressure, it is metamorphosed from peat to lignite.
