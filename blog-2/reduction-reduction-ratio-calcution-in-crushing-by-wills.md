Crusher Reduction Ratio I have mentioned the fact that, as the % of voids in the crushing chamber decreases, the production of fines by attrition increases. This is like saying that, as the Crusher Reduction Ratio in any given crusher is increased, the % of fines in the product will increase, even though the discharge setting remains unchanged.

The closed set of an operating jaw crusher was 125 mm. A continuous stream of ore was fed at the rate of 30 t h. On an average, 10% of the ore was less than the set. The F 80 was 410 mm in size. The crusher was initially operated at 200 rpm at a reduction ratio of 1:4, but the toggle speed was to be increased. Calculate 1.
