## Lead Essential Chemical Industry
The ore has first to be separated from clays and other silicates ('gangue') after which the lead ore and the zinc ore are separated. The process used is froth flotation, a succession of stages each delivering a greater concentration of the lead ore. The ore, containing gangue (which typically contains 3 8% lead) is ground with water to a particle size similar to that of fine sand (&lt;0.25 mm).
