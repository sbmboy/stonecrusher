## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its oresis may require a combination of comminution, mineral processing, hydrometallurgical, and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing, resulting in direct recovery of .

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.

Extraction of Metals. Industries extract metals from their ores. What are ores? Let me explain in a simple way. Usually, less reactive metals such as gold and silver are found in their pure form in the soil. But this is not the case with more reactive iron or aluminum. Usually iron and aluminum exist as compounds, with oxygen, also known as oxides.

## The Advantages of Recycling Copper Sciencing
Copper is a 100 percent recyclable material. According to the Copper Development Association, copper's recycling rate is higher than that of any other engineering metal. Every year in the United States, nearly as much copper is recycled as is mined. Excluding wire production, almost 75 percent of U.S. copper used comes from recycled copper scrap.

Extracting iron from iron ore using a Blast Furnace. The common ores of iron are both iron oxides, and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air. Coke is cheap and provides both the reducing agent for the reaction and also the heat source.

## How is copper extracted from a low grade ore of it topprm
 · Leaching is the process to extract pure copper from a low grade ore. Leaching is the process of extracting substances from a solid by dissolving them in a liquid, in this process the ore is dissolved in liquid but not impurities. Then the copper solution is reacted with iron to get pure copper (reduction process). Cu2 + + H2→ Cu(pure) + 2H+

## The Hunt and Douglas Process for Extracting Copper from
Page 8 The same amount of iron is required to precipitate a ton of copper, whether extracted from a poor or a rich ore but as for the smelting of the latter much less fuel is required, it follows that rich ores are generally treated by smelting rather than in the wet way, any saving of fuel in the latter being more than compensated for by the cost of iron.

## Biolixiviation: Extracting Copper from Ore Environmental 
Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), which accounts for about 50% of copper production. The focus of this article is on the process of copper extraction from chalcopyrite ore into pure metal. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed.
