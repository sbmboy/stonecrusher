# 100-120 th VU Tower-like Sand Making Plant

The project supplies manufactured sand and aggregate for expressway construction. Since a large amount of high-grade concrete is needed in the process of bridge construction, the construction unit not only have huge demand for manufactured sand, but also requires the high quality of it. However, the traditional sand-making process method has numerous defects such as large fineness modulus, high dust pollution，large footprint and etc. Thus, the customer decided to use VU aggregate optimization system to solve the problems. After the system was put into production, the plant has been running smoothly and the output keeps stable, which has brought great economic benefits to customer.

## Project Profile

**Material:** limestone(0-10mm)

**Final Product:** 0-0.075mm(stone powder),0.075—5mm(manufactured sand)

**Major Equipment:** VU120 aggregate optimization system

**Application:** Final product is mainly used as high-grade concrete material in expressway program.

## Processing

1. The gravel is crushed inside VU impact crusher to eliminate the needle shaped material. This process is meant to make the grains reach the required size.

2. The crushed stones are evenly conveyed to model-controlled screen through feeder, where the materials are graded. With the gradation of manufactured sand is precisely controlled, the unqualified material is returned to impact crusher for re-crushing until the size and shape reach the requirement. Besides, the stone powder is collected by dust collection system.

3. The qualified finished product enters Humidification agitator(optional) for wet mixing to control the moisture content of the sand, which will ensure the quality of the sand in a further step.

4. The excess stone powder produced will be collected by pulse dust collector, sent to finished product tank by pneumatic conveying system, and packed through packaging system for transportation in the end.

## Advantages
### 1)Finished Product with Higher Quality
VU Tower-like Sand-making System adopts original grinding technology and cascade fall shaping technology to make the finished product have reasonable grading and mellow grain shape, which effectively reduces the specific surface area and void of coarse and fine aggregates. In addition, dry powder removing technology is adopted to make the powder content in the finished sand adjustable and controllable.

### 2)Centralized Control System with Higher Automation
VU Tower-like Sand-making system is equipped with the centralized control system which can control and monitor all devices online and to quickly set or maintain operational parameters at optimal status, so that the quality of finished aggregates and the capacity of the plant gets well controlled.

### 3)Full Closed System, Excellent Environmental Protection
The VU Tower-like Sand-making System adopts totally enclosed structure and negative pressure dust removal design which ensure no wastewater, sludge, dust and noise during production, meeting the national environmental protection requirements.

### 4)Compact Structure Save Footprint
The intensive design significantly reduces footprint and facilitates the layout of the entire project.

### 5)Digitalized Processing, Higher Precision
From steel cutting, bending, planning, milling to painting, SBM embraces dozens of CNC production lines, all of which are digitally controlled and processed with high precision, ensuring the stable and reliable operation of the whole system.
