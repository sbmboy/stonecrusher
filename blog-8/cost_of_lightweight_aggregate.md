## Lightweight concrete
The required properties of the lightweight concrete will have a bearing on the best type of lightweight aggregate to use. If little structural requirement, but high thermal insulation properties, are needed then a light, weak aggregate can be used. This will result in relatively low strength concrete. Foamed concrete

A structural light weight concrete mix has a density of about 105 pounds per cubic foot compared to normal concrete with a density of 150 pounds per cubic foot. The light weight concrete density is less because lightweight coarse aggregates and sometimes lightweight fine aggregates are used, which make the concrete weigh less.

## Lightweight Aggregates: How Do You Make the Right Decision .
The use of lightweight aggregates may have an impact on the compressive strength of the concrete. Highly absorptive lightweight aggregate should be wetted at least 24 hours prior to use. It is not recommended that dry lightweight aggregate be directly batched and mixed because the aggregate particles can continue to absorb water from the mix.
