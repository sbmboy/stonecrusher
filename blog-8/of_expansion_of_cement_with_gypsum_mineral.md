## Gypsum Mineral Uses and Properties
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomitepsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4)e chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water.

## Dual role of gypsum: Set retarder and strength accelerator
gypsum regulates the heat of hydration as also the ettringite formation for progressive chemistry. In the anxiety of not to retard cement if the gypsum is reduced below the threshold level, heat of hydration is commensurately profuse leading to internal thermal stresses and incohesiveness. This is where the role of gypsum is evident as retarder.

## Role of Gypsum in Cement and its Effects The Constructor
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulphate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement, so its is generally termed as retarding agent of cement. It is mainly used for regulating the setting time of cement and is an indispensable component. Contents:1 What is [.]

## Question: What Is The Formula Of Gypsum?
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.

## Portland Cement Composition
High alumina cements generally set rapidly, and are "hot" cements. As gypsum seems to retard the rate of hydration of this component, it is added to all Portland cement clinker before grinding. The hydrated product is largely amorphous, but may be in small part crystalline; the amorphous product delivers calcium hydrate by hydrolysis. 3.

It was found that all the three factors are important from the point of view of selection of appropriate mineral admixture for blending with cement. The durability performance of concrete with blended cements was improved in terms of its resistance to the three deteriorating factors, namely alkali&#177;silica reaction (ASR), sulphate attack and the corrosion of steel reinforcement.

## Why gypsum is used in cement? AnswersDrive
Gypsum is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.
