## Gypsum Board an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Gypsum board face paper is commonly 100% recycled, from newsprint, cardboard, and other postconsumer waste streams, but most recycled gypsum in wallboard products is postindustrial from gypsum board manufacture. Gypsum board should be purchased in sizes that minimize the need for trimming (saving time and waste).

## Drywall Encyclopediam
Raw Materials. The primary component of drywall is the mineral gypsum. It is a light density rock found in plentiful deposits worldwide. Each molecule of gypsum (or dihydrous calcium sulfate) is composed of two molecules of water (H 2 0) and one of calcium sulfate (CaSO 4). By weight the compound is 21% water, but by volume it is nearly 50% water.
