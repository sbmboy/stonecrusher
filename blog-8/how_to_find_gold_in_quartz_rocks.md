## Can gold be found in small quartz rock no more than 5 feet .
It's very unlikely. Gold is very dense and never rusts, as the surrounding rock is weathered, tuned to clay and sand, it liberates gold. The gold tends to stick around due to its density, so it can accumulate in highly weathered soils above gold bearing quartz veins. The soils end up with a higher concentration than the original quartz veins.

Gold is found widely diffused in nature even though it is one of the scarcer metals. Very commonly, gold occurs as the native metal encased within quartz. Sometimes the gold is in a finely divided state, sometimes in particles of considerable size, as nuggets, grains, scales, plates, threads and wires in quartz rock.
