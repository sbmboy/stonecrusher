Taconite is a flintlike type of rock containing lowgrade iron ore. Vast reserves of taconite, with iron concentrations of 3050%, were discovered in 1870 near presentday Babbitt, on the Mesabi Iron Range. However these deposits were passed over in favor of mining existing high grade iron ore formations, because extracting the pure iron from

Taconite pellets are made from taconite ore (cherty or jaspery rock with a high iron content). As the iron ore of the great iron range of Minnesota which has been mined for more than 100 years became depleted of its rich ore, Dr. E.W. Davis of the University of Minnesota, along with other scientists and engineers, conducted years of laboratory tests and experiments to find a way to take the

Though taconite was identified as an iron bearing rock on the Iron Ranges of northern Minnesota long before the 1950s, it wasn't until then that it was profitably extracted, processed, and shipped to steel mills on the Great Lakes. As natural ore reserves were diminished, taconite became an alternative source of iron that allowed the Iron Range to continue mining operations in a changing .

## Minnesota Iron Iron Mining History
Today, however, the great bulk of the Mesabi Range iron formation remains as hard, magnetic taconite enough to last hundreds of years using conventional mining methods. With new mining methods being developed and in progress, the future of iron mining in northeastern Minnesota is bright. Iron is one of the most abundant metals found on earth.

Though taconite was identified as an iron bearing rock on the Iron Ranges of northern Minnesota long before the 1950s, it wasn’t until then that it was profitably extracted, processed, and shipped to steel mills on the Great Lakes. As natural ore reserves were diminished, taconite became an alternative source of iron that allowed the Iron Range to continue mining operations in a changing

## Taconite Wikipedia
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States was mining such an abundance of iron ore of high quality that taconite was considered an uneconomic waste product. By the end of World War II, however, much of the high grade iron ore in the United States had been exhausted. Taconite became valued as a new source of the metal.

## Secondary Breakage in Taconite Open Pit Mining
The mining of taconite, to provide feed for a processing plant, requires that the flow of material continue uninterrupted. This means first, that the crude must be of a size acceptable to the primary crusher in order to reduce the delays caused by plugging the crusher with chunks. Secondly, elimination of oversize in the pit will reduce costs of all wear parts used in the mining and processing

 · And just in time. By the 1950s, the last of the high grade lean ores were mined. The Iron Range was an important economic engine for Minnesota whose fate lies in just one thing: iron ore.

Next it goes to the separators where the iron ore is separated from the taconite using strong magnets this is the concentrate. The remaining waste rock is dumped into tailings basins. Taconite pellets are made by rolling the concentrate with clay inside rotating cylinders called agglomerators.

## Iron Range 101: What is taconite? Twin Cities Daily Planet
 · Taconite is a low grade iron ore. Originally thought to be of little value, taconite was considered overburden (waste) in the days when high grade iron ore was mined. The iron content, magnetite, is only 20 30% compared to 50 60 % iron content in red ore. Red ore is also referred to as direct shipped ore because it can be shipped without processing.
