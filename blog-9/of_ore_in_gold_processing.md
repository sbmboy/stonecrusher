Mineral Processing. If the mineralogy of the ore shows that you can separate discrete particles of the mineral you want from the gangue components of the ore, then it is possible to physically concentrate the valuable mineral and reject the rest. The easiest method for achieving this is by gravity separation.

The flotation process in general does not float free gold particles but is particularly effective when gold is associated with sulfide minerals such as pyrites. In a typical pyrytic gold ore, the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure. Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation.
