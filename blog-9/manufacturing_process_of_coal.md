## Coal utilization Liquefaction Britannica
Coal utilization Coal utilization Liquefaction: Liquefaction is the process of converting solid coal into liquid fuels. The main difference between naturally occurring petroleum fuels and coal is the deficiency of hydrogen in the latter: coal contains only about half the amount found in petroleum. Therefore, conversion of coal into liquid fuels involves the addition of hydrogen .

## What Is Metallurgical Coke? Sciencing
Metallurgical coke sounds like a soda beverage, but it's not. It is a refined carbon product made from a special kind of coal. Using extremely high temperatures, coal can purified into coke which is then used in the iron and steel making processes. One of the most important steps in the cokemaking process is

## About Manufactured Gas Plants
Manufacturing coal gas was labor intensive process. While the original focus of the manufactured gas industry was to supply small amounts of gas for street lighting systems, this changed with rapid growth of the mid 1800s. In the 1870's, a new technology emerged that produced gas from oil and water, called the "carburetted water gas" process.

Coal is a key part of the coke making process. The coal is crushed and ground into a powder and then charged into an oven where it is heated to approximately 1800°F in the absence of oxygen. As the oven is heated, the coal begins to melt so most of the volatile matter such as oil, tar, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur are removed.

Coal is an important part of the world energy budget. It is relatively inexpensive to locate and extract, and can be found all over the world. Unlike many renewable resources (such as solar or wind), coal production is not dependent on the weather. It is a baseload fuel, meaning it can be produced 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

## How a Coal Plant Works
Coal fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? Bright Hub Engineering
Coal is burnt in the boiler furnace to produce heat. Carbon in the coal and Oxygen in the air combine to produce Carbon Dioxide and heat. Stage 2. The second stage is the thermodynamic process. The heat from combustion of the coal boils water in the boiler to produce steam. In modern power plant, boilers produce steam at a high pressure and .

## What Are the Four Stages in Coal Formation? Referencem
The four stages in coal formation are peat, lignite, bituminous and anthracite. Each of these stages must be completed for coal to form. Stage one in coal production is peat. Peat is a fibrous substance that is oxidized by water and carbon dioxide. When a plant dies, and stays under water, it builds up an accumulation of peat.
