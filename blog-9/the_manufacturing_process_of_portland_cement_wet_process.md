## Cement Manufacturing Process Civil Engineering
Stage of Cement Manufacture. There are six main stages of cement manufacturing process. Stage 1 Raw Material Extraction Quarry. The raw cement ingredients needed for cement production are limestone (calcium), sand and clay (silicon, aluminum, iron), shale, fly ash, mill scale and bauxite. The ore rocks are quarried and crushed to smaller pieces of about 6 inches.

## The Manufacture of Portland Cement
The steps involved here depend on the process used. There are two main cement manufacturing processes currently used in New Zealand: the dry process (used by Golden Bay) and the wet process (used by Milburn). The dry process uses more energy in grinding but less in the kiln, and the wet process has lower overheads than the dry process. The two

The kiln has to operate continuously in order to ensure a steady regime, and therefore uniformity of clinker. The larger existing kiln in a wet process plant produces 3600 tonnes of clinker per day. The manufacture of cement by wet process is energy intensive and thus uneconomical as compared to dry process and semi dry process.

## Cement Extraction and processing Britannica
Cement Cement Extraction and processing: Raw materials employed in the manufacture of cement are extracted by quarrying in the case of hard rocks such as limestones, slates, and some shales, with the aid of blasting when necessary. Some deposits are mined by underground methods. Softer rocks such as chalk and clay can be dug directly by excavators.
