## From Ore to Finished Product Copper
Copper From Beginning to End. Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man. It is found in ore deposits around the world. It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago. And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC, was the first engineering material known to man.

## Copper Concentrates
The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method. Concentration of Ore: The ore is crushed into a fine powder and a suspension is created in water. To this are added, Collectors and Froth Stabilizers.

## The Extraction of Copper
Copper can be extracted from non sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution. Concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.
