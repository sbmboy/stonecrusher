CHAPTER 14. AGGREGATE PRODUCTION ENCE 420 ©Assakkaf Slide No. 6 TYPES OF CRUSHERS As stone passes through a crusher, the reduction in size may be expressed as reduction ratio. The reduction ratio is the ratio of crusher feed size to product size. The sizes are usually defined as the 80% passing size of the cumulative size distribution.

The difference between a conventional impactor and a VSI of the Barmac type is that the latter offers lower operating costs, but its reduction ratio is lower also. In a Barmac VSI, the material undergoes an intense rock on rock crushing process. In the other crushers, most of the reduction is done by the impact of stone against metal.
