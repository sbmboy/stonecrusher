## About Limestone
Limestone, also known as chalk, aragonite ,white marble, is mainly composed of CaCO3. Its Moh's hardness is around 3, soft and brittle. Lime can be used widely. Processed directly, it can be building aggregate; Calcined, quicklime; Powdered, the industrial raw material. Now, recycling limestone tailings to produce powder is a way turning waste into treasure.
