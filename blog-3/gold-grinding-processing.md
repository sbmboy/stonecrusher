## Amalgamation: Using Mercury to capture fine gold, retort .
Occasionally, the amalgamation process does not collect as much gold as anticipated. This type of result usually occurs when the formation of amalgam is inhibited due to poor contact between the gold and the mercury. This happens most commonly when the gold is very fine or when it .

## Arrastras. Historic Gold Mining Method for Processing Ore
The grinding process would continue, allowing the mercury and gold to amalgamate. When the process was nearing completion, several buckets of water were added to the arrastra, suspending the lighter material that was then bailed out, leaving just the small amounts of amalgamated gold at the bottom of the arrastra.

Falcon in the grinding circuit. By recovering 15% of the feed mass on a small Falcon C1000 (30t h) and treating only 12% of the cyclone underflow, one can easily recover over 80% of the gold by using continuous Falcon gravity units in the grinding circuit.

## How Is Gold Purified? Sciencing
If the gold is a low grade ore, then it is broken up into chunks that are then put in carefully lined pads and treated with a dilute cyanide solution, which dissolves the gold. For high grade ore, the metal is sent to a grinding mill and made into a powder.

## How gold is made
Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore, and more than one process may be used on the same batch of gold ore. Mining 1 In lode or vein deposits, the gold is mixed with another mineral, often quartz, in a vein that has filled a split in the surrounding rocks. Gold is obtained from lode deposits by drilling, blasting, or
