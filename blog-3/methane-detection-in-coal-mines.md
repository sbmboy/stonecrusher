## Gas Sensing Technology Improves Mine Safety Mar 14 2013 
In both deep and open cast coal mines methane gas is an ever present hazard. City’s methane and other flammable gas sensors have extensive approvals to the various global mining specifications. Specific regional issues are a further complication, for example, in South African mines, hydrogen cross sensitivity is a particular concern.

## Methane in Underground Mines • MineARC Systems
Coal mine methane (CMM) is a general term for all methane released mainly during and after mining operations. Although, methane captured prior to mining can also be considered associated to mining and thus can be considered as coal mine methane, it can also be termed as coalbed methane (CBM). CMM shows great variability in ﬂow rate and

Miners, and especially examiners, should exercise caution wherever high methane concentrations are suspected, particularly when entering or examining roof cavities. Miners and MSHA personnel should also fully understand the operation of multiple gas detection devices and the significance of their visual and audible alarms.
