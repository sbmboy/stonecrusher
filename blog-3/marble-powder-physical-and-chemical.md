## What Is the Chemical Formula for Marble? Reference
Marble is made of calcium carbonate, CaCO3, which is also what limestone is made from. The only difference between limestone and marble is the crystalline structure. Limestone crystals are much smaller than that of marble, and limestone is much more porous. Marble and limestone are common building materials due to their durability.
