## Magnetite Wikipedia
Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4 is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite.

leads to decrease in magnetic transition temperature (T(M), Table 1.). This may be attributed to negative pressure exerted on the lattice due to unit cell volume expansion. Hedley [12] has reported similar results for fine particles of hematite. The author has attributed the depression of T(M) to its known sensitivity to pressure in this system.

Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4 is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces .

## Magnetic nanoparticles: preparation, physical properties .
Feb 21, 2012 · Nanometer sized magnetic particles, such as super paramagnetic iron oxide particles, have been extensively used for separation and purification of cells and biomolecules in bioprocesses [93 95]. Due to their small size and high surface area, MNPs have many superior characteristics for these bioseparation applications compared to those of the .
