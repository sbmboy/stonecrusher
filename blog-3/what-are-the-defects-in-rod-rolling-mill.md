## Analysis of Chip Generation During Bar Rolling …
Bar rolling is a semi continuous rolling process involving a series of rollers, where a cast billet is shaped into the final TMT bar. In these mills, low thickness bar rolling (&lt; 20 mm) is prone to cobbles, due to several operational reasons, which affects productivity. One major contributor is blockage of slitters and no twist mill grooves due to excessive chip formation from the rolled bars.
