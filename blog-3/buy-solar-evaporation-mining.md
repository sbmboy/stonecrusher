## Solar Evaporation North American Salt Company
Solar Evaporation. Solar evaporation is the oldest and most energy efficient method of mineral production. At the Great Salt Lake in Utah, we draw highly saline waters from the lake&#39;s most remote areas into very shallow solar evaporation ponds. The sun naturally evaporates the water in these ponds over a three year span,&nbsp;

Other methods include dissolution mining and evaporation methods from brines. In the evaporation method, hot water is injected into the potash which is dissolved and then pumped to the surface where it is concentrated by solar induced evaporation. Amine reagents are then added to either the mined or evaporated solutions. The amine coats the KCl .

Salt evaporation ponds, also called salterns, salt works or salt pans, are shallow artificial ponds . For example, pans used in the solar evaporation of salt from sea water are usually found on the coast, while those used to extract salt from solution mined brine will be found near to the brine shaft. In this case, extra heat is often.
