## About Copper Ore
According to a report launched by CDA (Copper Development Association), in the 21st century, copper is widely used in electric and electronic industry such as the production of smart phone and computer, which brings potential market opportunities to the exploitation of copper ore.
## Copper Ore Crushing Technology
The production technologies mainly include 3 processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. For crushing, three-stage closed-circuit crushing process is suitable for super-hard copper and can separate the ore partly so as to improve the later grinding efficiency. For grinding, two-stage closed-circuit grinding process can fully grind the ore. For beneficiation, a typical modern beneficiation technology is mixed floatation. SBM, as a famous supplier of mining crushing solutions, can offer complete set of copper ore crushing equipment and comprehensive technical support to every customer.
