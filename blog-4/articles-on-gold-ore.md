## Extracting Gold HowStuffWorks
Removing the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

Sulfide ores, and pyrites in particular, have caused and continue to cause difficulty in recovering the gold values from these ores. In most instances, visible gold can not be seen under microscopic examination of pyrite gold ores. However, if the ore is ground to 200 mesh, most times, a few specs of gold can be visibly seen under microscopic .

## Gold Cyanidation Ground Truth Trekking
Cyanide can be used to extract gold, either in a controlled mill environment, or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions, and makes them soluble in water, thereby allowing separation from the rock.

Crushing the ore can free the gold and allow recovery by gravity based methods. In fact it's very common that the gold in hard rock ores will range in the 30 to 200 mesh size range with most of the gold in the lower end of that range. The tried and true method for testing these ores in the field is hand crushing and panning.

Gold bearing veins were discovered in the early 1870's, but their development was inhibited by the remoteness of the area and scarcity of fuel and water. Before 1900, however, the district yielded gold ore worth between 50,000 and 100,000, most of which came from the Eldorado mine.

In panning large samples, only one or two specks of gold could be seen, although the ore contained from 1 to 2 ounces per ton. This ore yielded only about 40 per cent, on being amalgamated, but over 90 per cent, was dissolved out by leaching the raw ore with cyanide of potassium, and similar results were obtained by chlorination.

This indicates that attempts to lessen the environmental impact of gold production should focus on these two stages. Mining and comminution are highly dependent on the grade of gold ore, as the lower the grade, the greater the amount that needs to be mined and the more crushing and grinding is required to extract the gold from the ore.
