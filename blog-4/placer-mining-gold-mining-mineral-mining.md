## Gold mining in Alaska Wikipedia
Gold mining in Alaska, a state of the United States, has been a major industry and impetus for exploration and settlement since a few years after the United States acquired the territory from Russia. Russian explorers discovered placer gold in the Kenai River in 1848, but no gold was produced. Gold mining started in 1870 from placers southeast of Juneau, Alaska.

Gold can be found by recreational prospecting in many of the waters of Minnesota. Most gold recovered is very finely textured flour gold. Quantities found in these placer deposits are generally not rich enough to attract much interest on a large scale, but many prospectors enjoy finding some of the nice gold present within Minnesota.

## Prospecting Placer Gold Deposits
Prospecting for placer gold, except perhaps in the case of buried placers, is the simplest form of prospecting. Gold, platinum, and tin are the principal metallic minerals won from placers, but gold (alloyed with varying percentages of silver) is the only metal that has been recovered in commercially important quantities from placers in the United States.
