## Coal Combustion Wastes
Background. Burning coal produces a variety of solid wastes known as coal combustion waste or coal combustion products. These include coal ash (fly ash and bottom ash), boiler slag, and flue gas desulphurization products. In 2007 over 120 million tons of these wastes were produced in the US, of which approximately 44% was reused in other applications.

## Waste heat Energy Education
Waste heat is the unused heat given to the surrounding environment (in the form of thermal energy) by a heat engine in a thermodynamic process in which it converts heat to useful worke second law of thermodynamics states that waste heat must be produced when converting a temperature difference into mechanical energy (which is often turned into electrical energy in power plants).

## Thermal pollution from coal plants SourceWatch
Thermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply .

## A simple model to help understand water use at power plants
Thermal power plants convert heat into power in the form of electricity. The heat is generated from a diverse range of sources, including coal, natural gas, uranium, solar energy, and geothermal energy. The heat rate (HR, kJ kWh) of a power plant is the amount of heat input required (kJ h) to produce one unit of electricity (kW) (see Equation 1 .

## Thermal pollution from coal plants SourceWatch
Thermal pollution is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the change in temperature impacts organisms by (a) decreasing oxygen supply

## Waste to Energy Gasification » GSTC
On average, conventional waste to energy plants that use mass burn incineration can convert one ton of MSW to about 550 kilowatt hours of electricity. With gasification technology, one ton of MSW can be used to produce up to 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity, a much more efficient and cleaner way to utilize this source of energy.

## How Does a Coal Power Plant Work?
Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources. The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption. Coal fired power plants, while producing power, require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.
