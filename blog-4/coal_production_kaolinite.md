## Coal Wikipedia
Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seamsal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed if dead plant matter decays into peat and over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial converts the peat into coal.

## Kaolin New Georgia Encyclopedia
Dec 12, 2003 · The word kaolin is now used as a loose trade and geologic term to refer to white clayey rock that is predominantly composed of Kaolin Group (khandite) minerals. The most common constituent is the mineral kaolinite. Kaolinite is a layered silocate made of alternating sheets of octahedrally coordinated aluminum and tetrahedrally coordinated silicon that are bonded by hydroxyl groups.

Coal is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seamsal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements; chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

1. Introduction. The difficulty in treating coal slime in the presence of clay minerals is well known in the coal preparation plant. Clay minerals (kaolinite, illite, and montmorillonite) have a detrimental effect on fine coal flotation because of mechanical coating and water entrainment, leading to low flotation recovery and poor flotation selectivity , .

Kaolinite has a low shrink swell capacity and a low cation exchange capacity, making it ideal for many industrial applications. Uses. During 2013, 48% of Kaolin was used in paper production, and 52% was used for ceramics, light bulbs, paint, rubber, adhesives, smoking pipes, white wash in masonry, absorbents, and in soap.

## Study of kaolinite rock in coal bearing stratum, North China
The mineral composition of coal kaolinite rock is mainly kaolinite, followed by a small amount of illite, montmorillonite, boehmite and rutile, hematite, siderite, chlorite, and so on, which generally contain a certain amount of organic carbon. The color of coal bearing kaolinite (soil) is rather deep, mostly light gray or gray black.

## Kaolinite Wikipedia
Kaolinite ( ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n aɪ t ) is a clay mineral, part of the group of industrial minerals with the chemical composition Al 2 Si 2 O 5 4 is a layered silicate mineral, with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO 4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO 6) octahedra. Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n or china clay.

## Swelling of clay minerals and its effect on coal 
The permeability damage of high‐rank coal reservoirs is the main factor affecting the development of coalbed methane (CBM) in the late production stage. Coal core samples from southern Qinshui Basin were saturated with actual formation water, 1 2 salinity formation water, and distilled water to study the swelling of clay minerals.

## Kaolin New Georgia Encyclopedia
 · The word kaolin is now used as a loose trade and geologic term to refer to white clayey rock that is predominantly composed of Kaolin Group (khandite) minerals. The most common constituent is the mineral kaolinite. Kaolinite is a layered silocate made of alternating sheets of octahedrally coordinated aluminum and tetrahedrally coordinated silicon that are bonded by hydroxyl groups.
