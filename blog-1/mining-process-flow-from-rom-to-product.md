## How Are Diamonds Mined And Extracted From the Ground
To make mining efficient and effective, the raw rock and soil are typically not examined on site. Instead, they are transported to special plants where the ore is processed and the rough diamonds are extracted. Depending on how rich the ore is, a few hundred tons of ore might be sieved just to produce a single carat of gem quality rough diamonds.

## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have .
Lithium obtained from salars is recovered in the form of lithium carbonate, the raw material used in lithium ion batteries. The production process is fairly straightforward and requires only natural evaporation, which leaves behind not only lithium, but also magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium.. The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million.
