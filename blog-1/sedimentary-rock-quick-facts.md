The name of a sedimentary rock depends on the size (and sometimes the shape) of the rock pieces that it is made of: Conglomerate is composed of rounded gravel, pebbles, cobbles, or boulders along with smaller rock pieces. Breccia is similar to a conglomerate except its gravel, pebbles, cobbles, or boulders have a sharper, angular shape.

Chert is a microcrystalline sedimentary rock consisting mostly of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) and can form in many different ways. It can form when microcrystals of silicon dioxide grow within soft sediments that will later become chalk or limestone. Chert is smooth to touch and usually glassy. It is a very hard rock and breaks with a conchoidal fracture and often produces very sharp edges.
